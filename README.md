# Toronto Bar Deals
App that let's you find bar deals close to you written in Kotlin using MVP and RxJava.

Will be expanding this to include collections of bars with a common theme (e.g. craft beer) that offer discounts if the
user purchases the package.

Also allows users to submit deals that they know of. There is a moderation tool for
admins to approve/deny user submitted deals.
